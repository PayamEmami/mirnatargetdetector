# payamemami/mirnatargetdetector: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
and processes data using miranda and RNAHybrid. The results are the merged hit files from miranda and RNAHybrid.

## Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.

**Output files:**

* `pipeline_info/`
  * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.csv`.
  * Documentation for interpretation of results in HTML format: `results_description.html`.

To see the distribution of scores in decoy and target you can use the following code in R

```r
# Read the files
all_lines<-readLines("miranda_merged_results.txt")
# Extract the seq headers
seqs<-all_lines[grepl(">>",all_lines,fixed = T)]

# Split the seq to get the scores
split_seq<-strsplit(seqs,split = "\t",fixed = T)

# Extract the scores

split_seq_scores<-sapply(split_seq,function(x){x[3]})

# Get the sequence name
names_seq<-sapply(aa,function(x){paste(x[c(1,2)], collapse = "-")})

# Convert the scores to Numbers
split_seq_scores<-as.numeric(split_seq_scores)

# plot the Decoy
plot(density(split_seq_scores[grepl(pattern = "_shuf",x = names_seq,fixed = T)]),col="red",main="Score distribution",
     xlab="Score")

# Plot the target
lines(density(split_seq_scores[!grepl(pattern = "_shuf",x = names_seq,fixed = T)]),col="blue")

# Add Legend
legend("topright",legend = c("decoy","target"),col = c("red","blue"),lty = c(1,1))
```

To calculate FDR you can use:

```r
score_fraction<-sapply(unique(split_seq_scores),function(x){sum(x<=split_seq_scores[grep(pattern = "_shuf",x = names_seq,fixed = T)])})

names(ee)<-unique(score_fraction)
FDR<-score_fraction[as.character(score_fraction)]/length(score_fraction)
```
